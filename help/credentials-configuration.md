## Supported authentication types {#supported-authentication-types}

Adobe Experience Platform supports several authentication types:

* Basic authentication
* Bearer authentication
* OAuth 2 with authorization code
* OAUth 2 with password grant
* OAuth 2 with client credentials grant

For the various supported OAuth 2 flows, as well as for custom OAuth 2 support, read the Destination SDK documentation on [OAuth 2 authentication](/help/oauth2-authentication.md).

You can configure the authentication information for your destination via the `customerAuthenticationConfigurations` parameters of the `/destinations` endpoint. Refer to the [customer authentication configurations section](/help/destination-configuration.md#customer-authentication-configurations) in the destination configuration article.

## When to use the `/credentials` API endpoint {#when-to-use}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>In most cases, you *do not* need to use the `/credentials` API endpoint. Instead, you can configure the authentication information for your destination via the `customerAuthenticationConfigurations` parameters of the `/destinations` endpoint.

Use the `activation/authoring/v1/credentials` API endpoint and select `PLATFORM_AUTHENTICATION` in the [destination configuration](/help/destination-configuration.md#destination-delivery) if there is a global authentication system between Adobe and your destination and the [!DNL Platform] customer does not need to provide any authentication credentials to connect to your destination. In this case, you must create a credentials object using the `/credentials` API endpoint. Read [Credentials API endpoint operations](/help/credentials-configuration-api.md) for a complete list of operations you can perform on the `/credentials` endpoint.
